==============================================================================
2. Introduction						*TwitVim-intro*

	TwitVim is a plugin that allows you to post to Twitter, a
	microblogging service at http://www.twitter.com.


==============================================================================
3. Installation						*TwitVim-install*

	
	1. Install OpenSSL or compile Vim with |Python|, |Perl|, |Ruby|, or |Tcl|.

	In order to compute HMAC-SHA1 digests and sign Twitter OAuth requests,
	TwitVim needs to either run the openssl command line tool from the
	OpenSSL toolkit or call a HMAC-SHA1 digest function via one of the
	above scripting interfaces.

	
							*TwitVim-OpenSSL*
	If you are using a precompiled Vim executable and do not wish to
	recompile Vim to add a scripting interface, then the OpenSSL approach
	is the simplest.

	If OpenSSL is not already on your system, you can download it from
	http://openssl.org/  If you are using Windows, check the OpenSSL FAQ
	for a link to a precompiled OpenSSL for Windows.

	After installing OpenSSL, make sure that the directory where the
	openssl executable resides is listed in your PATH environment
	variable so that TwitVim can find it.

	Note: TwitVim uses the openssl -hmac option, which is not available in
	old versions of OpenSSL. I recommend updating to OpenSSL 0.9.8o,
	1.0.0a, or later to get the -hmac option and the latest security
	fixes.


	Instead of using the openssl command line tool, you can also have
	TwitVim compute HMAC-SHA1 digests via a Vim scripting interface. This
	approach is significantly faster because it does not need to run an
	external program. You can use Perl, Python, Python 3, Ruby, or Tcl.

	Note: Additional setup may be needed on some systems to enable SSL,
	which we now require for security during the OAuth handshake. See
	|TwitVim-ssl|.


	If you compiled Vim with Perl, add the following to your vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_enable_perl = 1
<
	Also, verify that your Perl installation has the Digest::HMAC_SHA1
	module. This module comes standard in some Perl distributions, e.g.
	ActivePerl. In other Perl setups, you'll need to download and install
	Digest::HMAC_SHA1 from CPAN. The Perl Package Manager PPM may be
	helpful here.


	If you compiled Vim with Python, add the following to your vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_enable_python = 1
<
	Also, verify that your Python installation has the base64, hashlib,
	and hmac modules. All of these are in the Python standard library as
	of Python 2.5.

	If you compiled Vim with Python 3, add the following to your vimrc
	instead:
>
		let twitvim_enable_python3 = 1
<


	If you compiled Vim with Ruby, add the following to your vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_enable_ruby = 1
<
	TwitVim requires the openssl and base64 modules, both of which are
	in the Ruby standard library. However, you may need to install the
	OpenSSL library from http://www.openssl.org if it is not already on
	your system.


	If you compiled Vim with Tcl, add the following to your vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_enable_tcl = 1
<
	Also, verify that your Tcl installation has the base64 and sha1
	packages. These packages are in the Tcllib library. See
	|twitvim_enable_tcl| for help on obtaining and installing this
	library.


	2. Install cURL.				*TwitVim-cURL*

	If you don't already have cURL on your system, download it from
	http://curl.haxx.se/. Make sure that the curl executable is in a
	directory listed in your PATH environment variable, or the equivalent
	for your system.

	If you have already compiled Vim with Perl, Python, Python 3, Ruby, or
	Tcl for Step 1, I recommend that you use the scripting interface
	instead of installing cURL. See |TwitVim-non-cURL| for setup details.
	Using a scripting interface for network I/O is faster because it
	avoids the overhead of running an external program.


	3. twitvim_proxy				*twitvim_proxy*

	This step is only needed if you access the web through a HTTP proxy.
	If you use a HTTP proxy, add the following to your vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_proxy = "proxyserver:proxyport"
<
	Replace proxyserver with the address of the HTTP proxy and proxyport
	with the port number of the HTTP proxy.


	4. twitvim_proxy_login				*twitvim_proxy_login*

	If the HTTP proxy requires authentication, add the following to your
	vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_proxy_login = "proxyuser:proxypassword"
<
	Where proxyuser is your proxy user and proxypassword is your proxy
	password.

	It is possible to avoid having your proxy password in plaintext in
	your vimrc. See |TwitVim-login-base64| for details.


	5. Set twitvim_browser_cmd.

	In order to log in with Twitter OAuth, TwitVim needs to launch your
	web browser and bring up the Twitter authentication web page.

	See |twitvim_browser_cmd| for details. For example, if you use Firefox
	under Windows, add the following to your vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_browser_cmd = 'firefox.exe'
<
	Under Mac OS X, the following will use the default browser:
>
		let twitvim_browser_cmd = 'open'
<
	Note: If you do not set up twitvim_browser_cmd, TwitVim will display
	the authentication URL and wait for you to visit it in your browser
	manually and approve the application. If possible, this auth URL
	will be shortened with is.gd or Bit.ly for ease of entry.


	6. SSL prerequisites

	The Twitter API requires SSL. On most system setups, this should
	not be a problem but if you are having trouble connecting to
	Twitter with TwitVim, see |TwitVim-ssl| for instructions and
	prerequisites.


	7. Sign into Twitter with OAuth.

	Use any TwitVim command that requires authentication. For example,
	run |:FriendsTwitter|. |:SetLoginTwitter| is the normal way to
	initiate authentication without running a timeline command.

	Since TwitVim does not yet have an OAuth access token, it will
	initiate the Twitter OAuth handshake. Then it'll launch your web
	browser to a special Twitter web page that asks you to authorize
	TwitVim to use your account. On this page, sign in, if necessary,
	and then click on "Authorize app" to allow TwitVim access to your
	account.

	Twitter will then report that you have granted access to TwitVim
	and display a numeric PIN. Copy the PIN and paste it to the TwitVim
	input prompt "Enter OAuth PIN:".

	And now, you are ready to use TwitVim.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1. TwitVim and OAuth					*TwitVim-OAuth*

	After you log into Twitter with OAuth, TwitVim stores the OAuth
	access token in a file so that you won't have to log in again when
	you restart TwitVim. By default, this file is $HOME/.twitvim.token

						*twitvim_token_file*
	You can change the name and location of this token file by setting
	twitvim_token_file in your vimrc. For example:
>
		let twitvim_token_file = "/etc/.twitvim.token"
<
	Since the access token grants full access to your Twitter account,
	it is recommended that you place the token file in a directory that
	is not readable or accessible by other users.


						*twitvim_disable_token_file*
	If you are using TwitVim on an insecure system, you may prefer to 
	not save access tokens at all. To turn off the token file, add
	the following to your vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_disable_token_file = 1
<
	If the token file is disabled, TwitVim will initiate an OAuth
	handshake every time you restart it.


	If TwitVim is logged in and you need to log in as a different
	Twitter user:
	 - Visit the Twitter website in a web browser
	 - Sign out and then sign in as the other user.
	 - Then use |:SetLoginTwitter| to authenticate as that user.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1.1. OAuth Consumer Key			*TwitVim-OAuth-Consumer*

						*twitvim_consumer_key*
						*twitvim_consumer_secret*
	TwitVim comes with a default consumer key and secret pair. If you wish
	to use your own, add the following to your vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_consumer_key = "key"
		let twitvim_consumer_secret = "secret"
<
	where "key" and "secret" are consumer key and secret strings from the
	"My applications" section of the Twitter developers website after you
	have registered a Twitter application.

	The process of registering a Twitter application has changed from time
	to time. Currently, the steps are as follows:

	1. Go to https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new and fill in the details. Use
	anything you like for name, description, and website. Read and agree
	to the developer rules. No callback URL is needed.

	2. The Consumer key and secret are on the next screen under "OAuth
	settings". Add these strings to your vimrc.

	3. Go to the Settings tab. Select "Read, Write and Access direct
	messages" under Application Type / Access. Then click on "Update this
	Twitter application's settings". These permissions are required by
	TwitVim.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2. Base64-Encoded Login				*TwitVim-login-base64*

	For safety purposes, TwitVim allows you to configure your proxy
	login information preencoded in Base64. This is not truly secure as
	it is not encryption but it can stop casual onlookers from reading
	off your password when you edit your vimrc.

						*twitvim_proxy_login_b64*
	To configure the proxy login in base64, add the following to your
	vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_proxy_login_b64 = "base64string"
<
	Where base64string is your username:password encoded in Base64.


	An example:

	Let's say your HTTP proxy requires a login user name of "proxyuser"
	and a password of "proxypassword". So you need to encode
	"proxyuser:proxypassword" in Base64. You can either use a
	standalone utility or websites like the following:
	http://www.motobit.com/util/base64-decoder-encoder.asp
	http://www.opinionatedgeek.com/DotNet/Tools/Base64Encode/default.aspx
	http://www.base64encode.org/

	The result is: cHJveHl1c2VyOnByb3h5cGFzc3dvcmQ=

	Then you can add the following to your vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_login_b64 = "cHJveHl1c2VyOnByb3h5cGFzc3dvcmQ="
<
	And your setup is ready.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3. Alternatives to cURL				*TwitVim-non-cURL*

	TwitVim supports http networking through Vim's |Perl|, |Python|,
	|Ruby|, and |Tcl| interfaces, so if you have any of those interfaces
	compiled into your Vim program, you can use that instead of cURL.
	
	Generally, it is slightly faster to use one of those scripting
	interfaces for networking because it avoids running an external
	program. On Windows, it also avoids a brief taskbar flash when cURL
	runs.

	To find out if you have those interfaces, use the |:version| command
	and check the |+feature-list|. Then to enable this special http
	networking code in TwitVim, add one of the following lines to your
	vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_enable_perl = 1
		let twitvim_enable_python = 1
		let twitvim_enable_python3 = 1
		let twitvim_enable_ruby = 1
		let twitvim_enable_tcl = 1
<
	You can enable more than one scripting language but TwitVim will only
	use the first one it finds.


	1. Perl interface				*twitvim_enable_perl*

	To enable TwitVim's Perl networking code, add the following to your
	vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_enable_perl = 1
<
	TwitVim requires the MIME::Base64 and LWP::UserAgent modules. If you
	have ActivePerl, these modules are included in the default
	installation.


	2. Python interface				*twitvim_enable_python*
							*twitvim_enable_python3*

	To enable TwitVim's Python networking code, add the following to your
	vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_enable_python = 1
<
	TwitVim requires the urllib, urllib2, and base64 modules. These
	modules are in the Python standard library.

	If Vim is using Python 3, add the following to your vimrc instead:
>
		let twitvim_enable_python3 = 1
<
	For Python 3, TwitVim requires the urllib, socket, and base64 modules.
	These modules are in the Python 3 standard library.


	3. Ruby interface				*twitvim_enable_ruby*

	To enable TwitVim's Ruby networking code, add the following to your
	vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_enable_ruby = 1
<
	TwitVim requires the net/http, uri, and Base64 modules. These modules
	are in the Ruby standard library.

	In addition, TwitVim requires Vim 7.2.360 or later to fix an if_ruby
	problem with Windows sockets.

	Alternatively, you can add the following patch to the Vim sources:

	http://www.mail-archive.com/vim_dev@googlegroups.com/msg03693.html

	See also Bram's correction to the patch:

	http://www.mail-archive.com/vim_dev@googlegroups.com/msg03713.html


	3. Tcl interface				*twitvim_enable_tcl*

	To enable TwitVim's Tcl networking code, add the following to your
	vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_enable_tcl = 1
<
	TwitVim requires the http, uri, and base64 packages. uri and base64
	are in the Tcllib library so you may need to install that. See
	http://tcllib.sourceforge.net/

	If you have ActiveTcl 8.5, the default installation does not include
	Tcllib. Run the following command from the shell to add Tcllib:
>
		teacup install tcllib85
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4. Using Twitter SSL API				*TwitVim-ssl*

	On most up-to-date systems, you should be able to use SSL with no
	problems. In case you do run into problems, I review the
	prerequisites below.


	1. SSL via cURL					*TwitVim-ssl-curl*

	To use SSL via cURL, you need to install the SSL libraries and an
	SSL-enabled build of cURL.

							*twitvim_cert_insecure*
	Even after you've done that, cURL may complain about certificates that
	failed verification. If you need to override certificate checking, set
	twitvim_cert_insecure:
>
		let twitvim_cert_insecure = 1
<

	2. SSL via Perl interface			*TwitVim-ssl-perl*

	To use SSL via the TwitVim Perl interface (See |twitvim_enable_perl|),
	you need to install the SSL libraries and the Crypt::SSLeay Perl
	module.

	If you are using SSL over a proxy, do not set twitvim_proxy and
	twitvim_proxy_login. Crypt::SSLeay gets proxy information from the
	environment, so add this to your vimrc instead:
>
		let $HTTPS_PROXY="http://proxyserver:proxyport"
		let $HTTPS_PROXY_USERNAME="user"
		let $HTTPS_PROXY_PASSWORD="password"
<
	Alternatively, you can set these environment variables before starting
	Vim.


	3. SSL via Ruby interface			*TwitVim-ssl-ruby*

	To use SSL via Ruby, you need to install the SSL libraries and an
	SSL-enabled build of Ruby.

	If Ruby produces the error "`write': Bad file descriptor" in http.rb,
	then you need to check your certificates or override certificate
	checking. See |twitvim_cert_insecure|.

	Set twitvim_proxy and twitvim_proxy_login as usual if using SSL over a
	proxy.


	4. SSL via Python interface			*TwitVim-ssl-python*

	To use SSL via Python, you need to install the SSL libraries and an
	SSL-enabled build of Python.

	The Python interface does not yet support SSL over a proxy. This is
	due to a missing feature in urllib2.


	5. SSL via Tcl interface			*TwitVim-ssl-tcl*

	To use SSL via Tcl, you need to install the SSL libraries and Tcllib.
	To be more specific, TwitVim needs the tls package from Tcllib.

	Versions of Vim up to 7.3.450 have a bug that prevents the tls package
	from being loaded if you compile Vim with Tcl 8.5. This discussion
	thread explains the problem:
>
	http://objectmix.com/tcl/15892-tcl-interp-inside-vim-throws-error-w-clock-format.html
<
	If you need to use Twitter SSL with the Tcl interface, you can try one
	of the following workarounds:

	a. Upgrade Vim to version 7.3.451 or later.
	b. Downgrade Tcl to Tcl 8.4.
	c. Edit if_tcl.c in the Vim source code to remove the redefinition of
	catch. Then rebuild Vim.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.5. Hide the header in timeline and info buffers	*TwitVim-hide-header*

	In the timeline and info buffers, the first two lines are header
	lines. The first line tells you the type of buffer it is (e.g.
	friends, user, replies, direct messages, search in the timeline
	buffer; friends, followers, user profile in the info buffer) and other
	relevant buffer information. (e.g. user name, search terms, page
	number) The second line is a separator line.

	If you wish to suppress the header display, set twitvim_show_header
	to 0:

							*twitvim_show_header*
>
		let twitvim_show_header = 0
<
	If twitvim_show_header is unset, it defaults to 1, i.e. show the
	header.

	Note: Setting twitvim_show_header does not change the timeline buffer
	immediately. Use |:RefreshTwitter| to refresh the timeline (or
	|:RefreshInfoTwitter| to refresh the info buffer) to see the
	effect. Also, twitvim_show_header does not retroactively alter
	previous timelines in the timeline stack.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.6. Timeline filtering					*TwitVim-filter*

	TwitVim allows you to filter your timeline buffer to hide tweets
	containing a pattern.

	To enable timeline filtering, set twitvim_filter_enable to 1:

							*twitvim_filter_enable*
>
		let twitvim_filter_enable = 1
<
	Then set twitvim_filter_regex to the pattern you wish to filter out of
	the timeline. For example, to hide GetGlue tweets and tweets
	containing Youtube URLs, use the following:

							*twitvim_filter_regex*
>
		let twitvim_filter_regex = '@GetGlue\|/youtu\.be/'
<
	The filter is a regular expression. See |pattern| for patterns that
	are accepted. The |'ignorecase'| option sets the ignore-caseness of
	the pattern. |'smartcase'| is not used. The matching is always done
	like 'magic' is set and 'cpoptions' is empty. (Essentially, this is
	the same as |match()| because that is what it uses.)

	Be as specific as possible when setting the filter. For example, if
	you filter on "youtube", you are potentially also filtering out
	conversations about Youtube in addition to Youtube status updates.

	Timeline filtering removes tweets from your timeline, so the timeline
	display may be shorter than usual. Increase |twitvim_count| to
	compensate, if necessary.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.7. Preventing Loading					*TwitVim-noload*

	If you have TwitVim installed but for some reason don't wish to run
	it, then you can avoid loading the plugin by adding the following
	to your vimrc:
>
		let loaded_twitvim = 1
<

==============================================================================
4. TwitVim Manual					*TwitVim-manual*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1. TwitVim's Buffers					*TwitVim-buffers*

	TwitVim has 2 buffers, a timeline buffer and an info buffer.

	Commands such as |:FriendsTwitter|, |:MentionsTwitter|, |:DMTwitter|,
	and |:ListTwitter| bring up a timeline buffer. This buffer consists of
	a list of tweets or messages. See |TwitVim-mappings| for a list of
	mappings that are local to this buffer.

	Commands such as |:ProfileTwitter|, |:FollowingTwitter|,
	|:FollowersTwitter|, and |:OwnedListsTwitter| bring up an info buffer.
	This buffer may consist of a list of users or a list of Twitter lists.
	In the case of |:ProfileTwitter|, it is a list of fields from one user
	profile. Only a subset of the mappings in |:TwitVim-mappings| will
	work in the info buffer.

	TwitVim splits the window and opens a new timeline buffer only if one
	does not already exist. Otherwise, it reuses the existing timeline
	buffer. The same behavior applies to the info buffer.

						*twitvim_timestamp_format*
	You can customize the timestamp format in a timeline buffer by setting
	twitvim_timestamp_format. For example, to show only the time, add this
	to your vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_timestamp_format = '%I:%M %p'
<
	TwitVim uses |strftime()| to format timestamps, so you will need to
	check the manual page of the C function strftime() to see what
	formatting codes you can use here.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.2. Update Commands				*TwitVim-update-commands*

	These commands post an update to your Twitter account. If the friends,
	user, or public timeline is visible, TwitVim will insert the update
	into the timeline view after posting it.

	Note: If you are replying to a tweet, use the <Leader>r mapping in the
	timeline buffer instead. See |TwitVim-reply|. That mapping will set
	the in-reply-to field, which :PosttoTwitter can't handle.

	:PosttoTwitter					*:PosttoTwitter*

	This command will prompt you for a message and post it to Twitter.

	Note: Since this command uses input(), command-line editing and
	history features are available here. In particular, you can use
	<Up> and <Down> to recall previous tweets. See |history|.

	:CPosttoTwitter					*:CPosttoTwitter*

	This command posts the current line in the current buffer to Twitter.

	:BPosttoTwitter					*:BPosttoTwitter*

	This command posts the contents of the current buffer to Twitter.

	:SendDMTwitter {username}			*:SendDMTwitter*

	This command will prompt you for a direct message to send to user
	{username}.

        Note: As of mid-November, 2017, Twitter raised the character limit for
        status messages to 280-character.

        Note: As of mid-August, 2015, Twitter raised the character limit for
        direct messages to 10,000. However, the 140-character limit still
        applies to the regular tweets.

	Note: If you get a "403 Forbidden" error when you try to send a direct
	message, check if the user you're messaging is following you. That is
	the most common reason for this error when sending a direct message.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.3. Timeline Commands				*TwitVim-timeline-commands*

	These commands retrieve a Twitter timeline and display it in a special
	Twitter buffer. TwitVim applies syntax highlighting to highlight
	certain elements in the timeline view. See |TwitVim-highlight| for a
	list of highlighting groups it uses.


	:UserTwitter					*:UserTwitter*
	:UserTwitter {username}

	This command displays your Twitter timeline.

	If you specify a {username}, this command displays the timeline for
	that user.

							*twitvim_count*
	You can configure the number of tweets returned by :UserTwitter by
	setting twitvim_count. For example,
>
		let twitvim_count = 50
<
	will make :UserTwitter return 50 tweets instead of the default of 20.
	You can set twitvim_count to any integer from 1 to 200.


	:FriendsTwitter					*:FriendsTwitter*

	This command displays your Twitter timeline with updates from friends
	merged in.

	You can configure the number of tweets returned by :FriendsTwitter by
	setting |twitvim_count|.


	:MentionsTwitter				*:MentionsTwitter*
	:RepliesTwitter					*:RepliesTwitter*

	This command displays a timeline of mentions (updates containing
	@username) that you've received from other Twitter users.

	:RepliesTwitter is the old name for :MentionsTwitter.

	You can configure the number of tweets returned by :MentionsTwitter by
	setting |twitvim_count|.


	:DMTwitter					*:DMTwitter*

	This command displays direct messages that you've received.


	:DMSentTwitter					*:DMSentTwitter*

	This command displays direct messages that you've sent.


	:ListTwitter {list}				*:ListTwitter*
	:ListTwitter {user} {list}

	This command displays a Twitter list timeline.

	In the first form, {user} is assumed to be you so the command will
	display a list of yours named {list}.

	In the second form, the command displays list {list} from user
	{user}.


	:RetweetedToMeTwitter				*:RetweetedToMeTwitter*

	This command displays a timeline of retweets by others to you.


	:RetweetedByMeTwitter				*:RetweetedByMeTwitter*

	This command displays a timeline of retweets by you.


	:FavTwitter					*:FavTwitter*

	This command displays a timeline of your favorites.


	:FollowingTwitter				*:FollowingTwitter*
	:FollowingTwitter {user}

	This command displays a list of people you're following.

	If {user} is specified, this command displays a list of people that
	user is following.

	You can use Ctrl-PageUp and Ctrl-PageDown to page back and forth in
	this list. See |TwitVim-previous| and |TwitVim-next|.


	:FollowersTwitter				*:FollowersTwitter*
	:FollowersTwitter {user}

	This command displays a list of people who follow you.

	If {user} is specified, this command displays a list of people
	following that user.

	You can use Ctrl-PageUp and Ctrl-PageDown to page back and forth in
	this list. See |TwitVim-previous| and |TwitVim-next|.


	:ListInfoTwitter {list}				*:ListInfoTwitter*
	:ListInfoTwitter {user} {list}

	This command displays summary information on the Twitter list {list}
	owned by user {user}. If not specified, {user} is the currently
	logged-in user.


	:MembersOfListTwitter {list}			*:MembersOfListTwitter*
	:MembersOfListTwitter {user} {list}

	This command displays members of the Twitter list {list} owned by 
	user {user}. If not specified, {user} is the currently logged-in user.


	:SubsOfListTwitter {list}			*:SubsOfListTwitter*
	:SubsOfListTwitter {user} {list}

	This command displays subscribers to the Twitter list {list} owned by 
	user {user}. If not specified, {user} is the currently logged-in user.


	:OwnedListsTwitter				*:OwnedListsTwitter*
	:OwnedListsTwitter {user}

	This command displays the lists owned by {user}. If not specified,
	{user} is the currently logged-in user.


	:MemberListsTwitter				*:MemberListsTwitter*
	:MemberListsTwitter {user}

	This command displays the lists following {user}. If not specified,
	{user} is the currently logged-in user.


	:SubsListsTwitter				*:SubsListsTwitter*
	:SubsListsTwitter {user}

	This command displays the lists followed by {user}. If not specified,
	{user} is the currently logged-in user.


	:FollowListTwitter {user} {list}		*:FollowListTwitter*

	Start following the list {list} owned by {user}.


	:UnfollowListTwitter {user} {list}		*:UnfollowListTwitter*

	Stop following the list {list} owned by {user}.


	:BackTwitter					*:BackTwitter*

	This command takes you back to the previous timeline in the timeline
	stack. TwitVim saves a limited number of timelines. This command
	will display a warning if you attempt to go beyond the oldest saved
	timeline. See |TwitVim-C-o|.


	:BackInfoTwitter				*:BackInfoTwitter*

	This command is similar to |:BackTwitter| but takes you to the
	previous display in the info buffer stack instead. See |TwitVim-C-o|.


	:ForwardTwitter					*:ForwardTwitter*

	This command takes you to the next timeline in the timeline stack.
	It will display a warning if you attempt to go past the newest saved
	timeline so this command can only be used after :BackTwitter.
	See |TwitVim-C-i|.
	

	:ForwardInfoTwitter				*:ForwardInfoTwitter*

	This command is similar to |:ForwardTwitter| but takes you to the
	next display in the info buffer stack instead. See |TwitVim-C-o|.


	:RefreshTwitter					*:RefreshTwitter*

	This command refreshes the timeline. See |TwitVim-Leader-Leader|.


	:RefreshInfoTwitter				*:RefreshInfoTwitter*

	This command refreshes the info buffer. See |TwitVim-Leader-Leader|.


	:NextTwitter					*:NextTwitter*

	This command loads the next (older) page in the timeline.
	See |TwitVim-C-PageDown|.


	:NextInfoTwitter				*:NextInfoTwitter*

	This command loads the next page in the info buffer.
	See |TwitVim-C-PageDown|.


	:PreviousTwitter				*:PreviousTwitter*

	This command returns to the first (newest) page in the timeline. If
	the timeline is already on the first page, this command issues a
	warning and doesn't do anything. See |TwitVim-C-PageUp|.


	:PreviousInfoTwitter				*:PreviousInfoTwitter*

	This command loads the previous page in the info buffer. If the info
	buffer is on the first page, this command issues a warning and doesn't
	do anything. See |TwitVim-C-PageUp|.


	:SetLoginTwitter				*:SetLoginTwitter*

	This command initiates an OAuth login handshake. 

	Use this command if you need to log in as another Twitter user.
	When the authentication web page comes up, use the "Sign Out" link
	to log in as a different user and grant TwitVim access to that
	user.
	
	When you use SetLoginTwitter, TwitVim does not discard the previous
	access token. So you can switch back to the previous user using
	|:SwitchLoginTwitter|.


	:SwitchLoginTwitter				*:SwitchLoginTwitter*
	:SwitchLoginTwitter {username},{service}

	Switch to another user from the list of saved logins. If
	{username},{service} is not specified, SwitchLoginTwitter will display
	a list of logins and prompt you to select one of those.

	Tab completion is available for this command, so you can enter
	:SwitchLoginTwitter, the space key, and then the tab key to pick from
	a list of saved logins.

	SwitchLoginTwitter knows only about user accounts to which you have
	logged in previously. To switch to a new user account, use
	|:SetLoginTwitter| instead.


	:DeleteLoginTwitter				*:DeleteLoginTwitter*
	:DeleteLoginTwitter {username},{service}

	Deletes a user from the list of saved logins. If {username},{service}
	is not specified, DeleteLoginTwitter will display a list of logins and
	prompt you to select one of those.

	Tab completion is available for this command, so you can enter
	:DeleteLoginTwitter, the space key, and then the tab key to pick from
	a list of saved logins.

	DeleteLoginTwitter knows only about user accounts to which you have
	logged in previously.
	
	Note: You cannot delete the currently active user. If you need to do
	so, use :SwitchLoginTwitter to switch to another user first.


	:ResetLoginTwitter				*:ResetLoginTwitter*

	This command discards the current OAuth access token and all saved
	tokens. The next TwitVim command that needs authentication will
	initiate an OAuth handshake.

	After using ResetLoginTwitter, you won't be able to switch to any
	users using |:SwitchLoginTwitter| because ResetLoginTwitter discards
	all saved access tokens. Use |:DeleteLoginTwitter| instead if you only
	wish to discard one saved token.


	:FollowTwitter {username}			*:FollowTwitter*

	Start following user {username}'s timeline. If the user's timeline is
	protected, this command makes a request to follow that user.

	Note: This command does not enable notifications for the target user.
	If you need that, you'll have to do that separately through the web
	interface.


	:UnfollowTwitter {username}			*:UnfollowTwitter*

	Stop following user {username}'s timeline.


	:BlockTwitter {username}			*:BlockTwitter*

	Block user {username}.


	:UnblockTwitter {username}			*:UnblockTwitter*

	Unblock user {username}.


	:MuteTwitter {username}				*:MuteTwitter*

	Mute user {username}.


	:UnmuteTwitter {username}			*:UnmuteTwitter*

	Unmute user {username}.


	:ReportSpamTwitter {username}			*:ReportSpamTwitter*

	Reports user {username} for spam. This command will also block the
	user.


	:EnableRetweetsTwitter {username}	*:EnableRetweetsTwitter*

	Start showing retweets from user {username} in friends timeline.
	
	Note: This option may not take effect immediately since Twitter uses
	cached data to construct the timeline.


	:DisableRetweetsTwitter {username}	*:DisableRetweetsTwitter*

	Stop showing retweets from user {username} in friends timeline.
	
	Note: This option may not take effect immediately since Twitter uses
	cached data to construct the timeline.


	:AddToListTwitter {listname} {username}		*:AddToListTwitter*

	Adds user {username} to list {listname}.


	:RemoveFromListTwitter {listname} {username}	*:RemoveFromListTwitter*

	Removes user {username} from list {listname}.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.4. Mappings						*TwitVim-mappings*

	Alt-T						*TwitVim-A-t*
	Ctrl-T						*TwitVim-C-t*

	In visual mode, Alt-T posts the highlighted text to Twitter.

	Ctrl-T is an alternative to the Alt-T mapping. In GUI Vim on
	certain platforms like Windows, if the menu bar is enabled, Alt-T
	pulls down the Tools menu. So use Ctrl-T instead.


							*TwitVim-reply*
	Alt-R						*TwitVim-A-r*
	<Leader>r					*TwitVim-Leader-r*

	This mapping is local to the timeline buffer. In the timeline buffer,
	it starts composing an @-reply on the command line to the author of
	the tweet on the current line.

	Under Cygwin, Alt-R is not recognized so you can use <Leader>r as an
	alternative. The <Leader> character defaults to \ (backslash) but see
	|mapleader| for information on customizing that.

	Note: Since this command uses input(), command-line editing and
	history features are available here. In particular, you can use
	<Up> and <Down> to recall previous tweets. See |history|.


							*TwitVim-reply-all*
	<Leader>Ctrl-R					*TwitVim-Leader-C-r*

	This mapping is local to the timeline buffer. It starts composing a
	reply to all, i.e. a reply to the tweet author and also to everyone
	mentioned in @-replies on the current line.

	<Leader>Q					*TwitVim-Leader-Q*

	This mapping is local to the timeline buffer. It starts composing a
	tweet with tweet URL.

							*TwitVim-retweet*
	<Leader>R					*TwitVim-Leader-S-r*

	This mapping (Note: uppercase 'R' instead of 'r'.) is local to the
	timeline buffer. It is similar to the retweet feature in popular
	Twitter clients. In the timeline buffer, it retweets the current line.


							*twitvim_old_retweet*
	If you prefer old-style retweets, add this to your vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_old_retweet = 1
<	
	The difference is an old-style retweet does not use the retweet API.
	Instead, it copies the current line to the command line so that you
	can repost it as a new tweet and optionally edit it or add your own
	comments. Note that an old-style retweet may end up longer than 140
	characters. If you have problems posting a retweet, try editing it to
	make it shorter.

						    *twitvim_retweet_format*
	If you use old-style retweets, you can configure the retweet format.
	By default, TwitVim retweets tweets in the following format:

		RT @user: text of the tweet

	You can customize the retweet format by adding the following to your
	vimrc, for example:
>
		let twitvim_retweet_format = 'Retweet from %s: %t'

		let twitvim_retweet_format = '%t (retweeted from %s)'
<
	When you retweet a tweet, TwitVim will replace "%s" in
	twitvim_retweet_format with the user name of the original poster and
	"%t" with the text of the tweet.

	The default setting of twitvim_retweet_format is "RT %s: %t"


							*TwitVim-direct-message*
	Alt-D						*TwitVim-A-d*
	<Leader>d					*TwitVim-Leader-d*

	This mapping is local to the timeline buffer. In the timeline buffer,
	it starts composing a direct message on the command line to the author
	of the tweet on the current line.

	Under Cygwin, Alt-D is not recognized so you can use <Leader>d as an
	alternative. The <Leader> character defaults to \ (backslash) but see
	|mapleader| for information on customizing that.

	Note: If you get a "403 Forbidden" error when you try to send a direct
	message, check if the user you're messaging is following you. That is
	the most common reason for this error when sending a direct message.


							*TwitVim-goto*
	Alt-G						*TwitVim-A-g*
	<Leader>g					*TwitVim-Leader-g*

	This mapping is local to the timeline and info buffers. It
	launches the web browser with the URL at the cursor position. If you
	visually select text before invoking this mapping, it launches the web
	browser with the selected text as is.

	Special cases:

	- If the cursor is on a word of the form @user or in the user: portion
	  at the beginning of a line, TwitVim displays that user's
	  timeline.

	- If the cursor is on a Name: line in the info buffer, TwitVim
	  displays that user's timeline.

	- If the cursor is on a word of the form #hashtag, TwitVim does a
	  Twitter Search for that #hashtag.

	- In a trending topics buffer, TwitVim does a Twitter Search for the
	  phrase on the cursor line.


							*twitvim_browser_cmd*
	Before using this command, you need to tell TwitVim how to launch your
	browser. For example, you can add the following to your vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_browser_cmd = 'firefox.exe'
<
	Of course, replace firefox.exe with the browser of your choice.

	Under Mac OS X, the following will use the default browser:
>
		let twitvim_browser_cmd = 'open'
<

							*TwitVim-LongURL*
	<Leader>e					*TwitVim-Leader-e*

	This mapping is local to the timeline and info buffers. It
	calls the LongURL API (see http://longurl.org/) to expand the short
	URL at the cursor position. A short URL is a URL from a URL shortening
	service such as TinyURL, SnipURL, etc. Use this feature if you wish to
	preview a URL before browsing to it with |TwitVim-goto|.

	If you visually select text before invoking this mapping, it calls the
	LongURL API with the selected text as is.

	If successful, TwitVim will display the result from LongURL in the
	message area.


							*TwitVim-profile*
	<Leader>p					*TwitVim-Leader-p*

	This mapping is local to the timeline and info buffers. It retrieves
	user profile information (e.g. name, location, bio, update count) for
	the user name at the cursor position. It displays the profile
	information in an info buffer.

	If you visually select text before invoking this mapping, it uses the
	selected text for the user name.

	See also |:ProfileTwitter|.


							*TwitVim-inreplyto*
	<Leader>@					*TwitVim-Leader-@*

	This mapping is local to the timeline buffer. If the current line is
	an @-reply tweet, it retrieves the tweet to which this one is
	replying. Then it will display that predecessor tweet below the
	current one.
	
	If there is no in-reply-to information, it will show a warning and do
	nothing.

	This mapping is useful in the replies timeline. See |:RepliesTwitter|.


							*TwitVim-delete*
	<Leader>X					*TwitVim-Leader-X*

	This mapping is local to the timeline buffer. The 'X' in the mapping
	is uppercase. It deletes the tweet or direct message on the current
	line.

	Note: You have to be the author of the tweet in order to delete it.
	However, you can delete direct messages that you sent or received.


							*TwitVim-fave*
							*TwitVim-Leader-f*
	<Leader>f

	This mapping is local to the timeline buffer. It adds the tweet on the
	current line to your favorites.


							*TwitVim-unfave*
							*TwitVim-Leader-C-f*
	<Leader>Ctrl-F

	This mapping is local to the timeline buffer. It removes the tweet on
	the current line from your favorites.


	Ctrl-O						*TwitVim-C-o*

	This mapping takes you to the previous timeline in the timeline stack.
	See |:BackTwitter|.

	This mapping also works in the info buffer but uses a separate history
	stack. See |:BackInfoTwitter|.


	Ctrl-I						*TwitVim-C-i*

	This mapping takes you to the next timeline in the timeline stack.
	See |:ForwardTwitter|.

	This mapping also works in the info buffer but uses a separate history
	stack. See |:ForwardInfoTwitter|.


							*TwitVim-refresh*
	<Leader><Leader> 				*TwitVim-Leader-Leader*

	This mapping refreshes the timeline. See |:RefreshTwitter|.

	This mapping also works in the info buffer but is of limited utility
	there because that info shouldn't change as often as a timeline.
	See |:RefreshInfoTwitter|.


							*TwitVim-next*
	Ctrl-PageDown					*TwitVim-C-PageDown*

	This mapping loads the next (older) page in the timeline.
	See |:NextTwitter|.

	This mapping also works in the info buffer but only if the list is
	long enough to use more than one page. It does nothing in the user
	profile display. See |:NextInfoTwitter|.

	
							*TwitVim-previous*
	Ctrl-PageUp					*TwitVim-C-PageUp*

	This mapping returns to the first (newest) page in the timeline. If
	the timeline is already on the first page, it issues a warning and
	doesn't do anything. See |:PreviousTwitter|.

	This mapping also works in the info buffer but only if the list is
	long enough to use more than one page. It does nothing in the user
	profile display. See |:PreviousInfoTwitter|.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.5. Utility Commands					*TwitVim-utility*

	Note: You do not need these URL shortening services to post to
	Twitter. Simply add the full URL to your tweet and Twitter will use
	its own URL wrapper.


	:BitLy						*:BitLy*
	:BitLy {url}

	bit.ly is a URL forwarding and shortening service. See
	https://bitly.com/

	This command calls the bit.ly API to get a short URL in place of
	{url}. If {url} is not provided on the command line, the command will
	prompt you to enter a URL. The short URL is then inserted into the
	current buffer at the current position.

	The bit.ly API requires bit.ly access token. A default
	access token is provided with TwitVim and no configuration is
	needed.
	
	However, if you wish to supply your own access token to track
	your bit.ly history and stats:
	- Go to https://bitly.com/a/oauth_apps
	- Enter your password and click on "Generate Token".
	- Copy the string below "Generic Access Token" and then add the
	  following to your vimrc:

							*twitvim_bitly_key*
>
		let twitvim_bitly_key = "accesstoken"
<
	Where accesstoken is the string you obtained from bit.ly.

	Note: The bit.ly access token is not the same as the bit.ly API key
	used in TwitVim 0.8 and earlier. If you are upgrading TwitVim and
	have a bit.ly API key in your vimrc, you'll need to replace it with
	a bit.ly access token.

	:ABitLy						*:ABitLy*
	:ABitLy {url}

	Same as :BitLy but appends, i.e. inserts after the current
	position instead of at the current position, the short URL instead.

	:PBitLy						*:PBitLy*
	:PBitLy {url}
	
	Same as :BitLy but prompts for a tweet on the command line with
	the short URL already inserted.


	:IsGd						*:IsGd*
	:IsGd {url}

	is.gd is a URL forwarding and shortening service. See
	http://is.gd

	This command calls the is.gd API to get a short URL in place of <url>.
	If {url} is not provided on the command line, the command will prompt
	you to enter a URL. The short URL is then inserted into the current
	buffer at the current position.

	:AIsGd						*:AIsGd*
	:AIsGd {url}

	Same as :IsGd but appends, i.e. inserts after the current position
	instead of at the current position, the short URL instead.

	:PIsGd						*:PIsGd*
	:PIsGd {url}
	
	Same as :IsGd but prompts for a tweet on the command line with the
	short URL already inserted.


	:Googl						*:Googl*
	:Googl {url}

	Goo.gl is Google's URL forwarding and shortening service.
	See http://goo.gl/

	This command calls the goo.gl API to get a short URL in place of
	<url>. If {url} is not provided on the command line, the command will
	prompt you to enter a URL. The short URL is then inserted into the
	current buffer at the current position.

	:AGoogl						*:AGoogl*
	:AGoogl {url}

	Same as :Googl but appends, i.e. inserts after the current position
	instead of at the current position, the short URL instead.

	:PGoogl						*:PGoogl*
	:PGoogl {url}
	
	Same as :Googl but prompts for a tweet on the command line with the
	short URL already inserted.


	:SearchTwitter					*:SearchTwitter*
	:SearchTwitter {query}
	
	This command calls the Search API to search for {query}. If {query} is
	not provided on the command line, the command will prompt you for it.
	Search results are then displayed in the timeline buffer.

	All of the Twitter Search operators are supported implicitly. For a
	list of search operators, see:
	https://support.twitter.com/groups/31-twitter-basics/topics/110-search/articles/71577-how-to-use-advanced-twitter-search

	You can configure the number of tweets returned by :SearchTwitter by
	setting |twitvim_count|.


	:RateLimitTwitter				*:RateLimitTwitter*

	This command retrieves rate limit information. It shows the current
	limit, how many API calls you have remaining, and when your quota will
	be reset. You can use it to check if you have been temporarily locked
	out of Twitter for hitting the rate limit.

	As of Twitter API 1.1, rate limits are per API endpoint. This
	command displays one line per API endpoint and is very verbose.


	:ProfileTwitter					*:ProfileTwitter*
	:ProfileTwitter {username}

	This command retrieves user profile information (e.g. name, location,
	bio, update count) for the specified user {username}. It displays the
	information in an info buffer.

	If {username} is not specified, this command will retrieve
	information for the currently logged-in user.

	See also |TwitVim-Leader-p|.


	:LocationTwitter {location}			*:LocationTwitter*

	This command sets the location field in your profile. There is no
	mandatory format for the location. It could be a zip code, a town,
	coordinates, or pretty much anything.

	For example:
>
	:LocationTwitter 10027
	:LocationTwitter New York, NY, USA
	:LocationTwitter 40.811583, -73.954486
<

	:TrendTwitter					*:TrendTwitter*

	This command retrieves a list of Twitter trending topics and displays
	them in the timeline buffer.

	In trending topics, |TwitVim-Leader-g| does a Twitter search for the
	phrase on the cursor line.

	By default, this command shows worldwide trends. To show regional
	trends, use |:SetTrendLocationTwitter| or set |twitvim_woeid|.


	:SetTrendLocationTwitter		 *:SetTrendLocationTwitter*

	This command displays a menu of trend locations by country and by
	town. It sets the region for |:TrendTwitter|.
	

							*twitvim_woeid*
	If you wish to set the default location for |:TrendTwitter| to
	something other than worldwide, set twitvim_woeid in your vimrc.
	
	For example:
>
		let twitvim_woeid = 2357024
<
	sets the location to Atlanta.
	
	You can find out what number to use for a location by checking the
	message displayed after |:SetTrendLocationTwitter| or by checking
	twitvim_woeid after |:SetTrendLocationTwitter|.


==============================================================================
5. Timeline Highlighting				*TwitVim-highlight*

	TwitVim uses a number of highlighting groups to highlight certain
	elements in the Twitter timeline views. See |:highlight| for details
	on how to customize these highlighting groups.

	twitterUser					*hl-twitterUser*
	
	The Twitter user name at the beginning of each line.

	twitterTime					*hl-twitterTime*

	The time a Twitter update was posted.

	twitterTitle					*hl-twitterTitle*

	The header at the top of the timeline view.

	twitterLink					*hl-twitterLink*

	Link URLs and #hashtags in a Twitter status.

	twitterReply					*hl-twitterReply*

	@-reply in a Twitter status.


==============================================================================
6. Tips and Tricks					*TwitVim-tips*

	Here are a few tips for using TwitVim more efficiently.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.1. Timeline Hotkeys					*TwitVim-hotkeys*

	TwitVim does not autorefresh. However, you can make refreshing your
	timeline easier by mapping keys to the timeline commands. For example,
	I use the <F8> key for that:
>
		nnoremap <F8> :FriendsTwitter<cr>
		nnoremap <S-F8> :UserTwitter<cr>
		nnoremap <A-F8> :RepliesTwitter<cr>
		nnoremap <C-F8> :DMTwitter<cr>
<

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.2. Line length in status line				*TwitVim-line-length*

	Add the following to your |'statusline'| to display the length of the
	current line:
>
		%{strlen(getline('.'))}
<	
	This is useful if you compose tweets in a separate buffer and post
	them with |:CPosttoTwitter|. With the line length in your status line,
	you will know when you've reached the 140-character boundary.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.3. Network timeout				*TwitVim-network-timeout*

	TwitVim may have problems connecting to Twitter sometimes. The system
	default for socket timeouts may be as long as a few minutes, so
	TwitVim will appear to hang for that length of time before displaying
	an error message.

							*twitvim_net_timeout*
	You can set twitvim_net_timeout to reduce this timeout interval. For
	example, add the following to your vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_net_timeout = 30
<
	to set the network timeout to 30 seconds.

	Note: This option does not seem to work correctly if you are using
	|twitvim_enable_perl|. It may take longer than that number of seconds
	to time out.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6.4. Post Tweets including newlines		*TwitVim-allow-multiline*

	By default TwitVim will strip newlines from tweets. This is apparent
	when posting from a buffer.

						*twitvim_allow_multiline*
	You can set twitvim_allow_multiline to allow posting multiline
	messages. Just add the following to your vimrc:
>
		let twitvim_allow_multiline = 1
<


==============================================================================

			   * Change character limit to 280.
			   * Support vim8 job.

			     automatically if user install vimproc.
	0.9.0 : 2015-04-10 * Removed identi.ca support and legacy code.
			   * Removed support for old token file formats.
			   * Removed old Twitter search code.
			   * Removed some obscure URL shortening services.
			   * Updated to bit.ly v3 API.
			   * Removed old goo.gl URL shortening code.
			   * Removed services menu because we only have
			     Twitter now.
			   * Removed public timeline command.
			   * Moved most of the plugin code to an autoload
			     file.

	0.8.2 : 2014-03-26 * Change Twitter API URLs to https. Twitter no
			     longer supports non-SSL.
			   * Added support for highlighting $stocksymbol
		             and jumping to searches for $stocksymbol.
			   * Perform zero-length message check before
			     get_cur_service() so a non-logged-in user can
			     cancel.
			   * Made a proper folder structure and added a
			     vimball packing script.
	0.8.1 : 2013-08-12 * Fix for suspended users in followers list.
			   * Rewrote URL regex for new regex engine in Vim 7.4.
	0.8.0 : 2013-01-02 * Support for Twitter API 1.1.

			     omit extraneous trailing characters.
	0.7.4 : 2012-05-04 * Allow users to customize timestamp format in
			     timeline displays. |twitvim_timestamp_format|
			   * Take Twitter's URL-wrapping into account when
			     counting characters in tweets. You do not have to
			     shorten URLs manually any more. Just post to

			     ensure that the tweet fits the 140-character
			     limit after Twitter's t.co link-wrapping.
			   * Added network timeout option.
			     |twitvim_net_timeout|
			   * Added Python 3 networking and OAuth code.
			     |twitvim_enable_python3|
			   * Switched from page-style pagination to
			     max_id-style pagination because page-style

			     timeline commands will cease to accept [count]
			     parameters and |:PreviousTwitter| will return to
			     the top page regardless of current page number.
			   * Switched to new API for |:FollowingTwitter| and
			     |:FollowersTwitter| because the old API was
			     deprecated.
			   * |:FollowTwitter| now stops you from following a
			     user that you are already following. This is to
			     avoid triggering a Twitter bug where the
			     following flag reverts to 'follow request sent'
			     if the subject's timeline is protected.
	0.7.3 : 2012-01-17 * Switched to JSON API for Twitter Search so that
			     TwitVim can support t.co URL expansion and
			     in-reply-to in search results.
			   * Made the URL-matching pattern more accurate.

			   * Added t.co URL expansion for media URLs too.
			   * Added confirmation prompt before new-style
			     retweet.
			   * Request trends in JSON format. XML format no
			     longer works.
			   * Read token file before |:SwitchLoginTwitter|

			   * Show 'follow request sent' in user profile
			     display if that is the case.
	0.7.0 : 2011-07-06 * Replaced many deprecated Twitter API calls with
			     updated versions.
			   * Improved XML parsing speed for high
			     |twitvim_count|.
			   * Added |:SwitchLoginTwitter| and other code to
			     support multiple saved OAuth logins.
	0.6.3 : 2011-05-13 * Expand t.co URLs in timeline displays.

	0.6.2 : 2011-02-21 * Added more user relationship info to
			     |:ProfileTwitter|.
			   * Added |:EnableRetweetsTwitter| and

			   * Added |:MembersOfListTwitter|,
			     |:SubsOfListTwitter|, |:OwnedListsTwitter|,
			     |:MemberListsTwitter|, |:SubsListsTwitter|,
			     |:FollowListTwitter|, |:UnfollowListTwitter|.
			   * Added support for goo.gl |:Googl| and Rga.la.
			     |:Rgala|
			   * Extended |TwitVim-Leader-g| to support Name: lines
			     in user profile and following/followers lists.
			   * Added history stack for info buffer.
			   * Added |:BackInfoTwitter|, |:ForwardInfoTwitter|,
			     |:RefreshInfoTwitter|, |:NextInfoTwitter|,

			     |TwitVim-C-PageUp| in info buffer.
			   * Added twitvim filetype for user customization
			     via autocommands.

			     info on logged-in user.
			   * Make |TwitVim-Leader-@| work on new-style

	0.2.14 : 2008-05-12 * Added support for Summize search API.
	0.2.13 : 2008-05-07 * Added mappings to launch web browser on URLs in

8. TwitVim Credits					*TwitVim-credits*

	Thanks to Travis Jeffery, the author of the original VimTwitter script
	(vimscript #2124), who came up with the idea of running cURL from Vim
	to access the Twitter API.

	Techniques for managing the Twitter buffer were adapted from the NERD
	Tree plugin (vimscript #1658) by Marty Grenfell.
